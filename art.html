        <p>The Seven Server is a multicultural community <br>
             (if you include john) and this is represented in a <br> 
             photo of member "Toaster" being in touch with his <br> european side.<br>

        <p>In this image, Server Member and Owner "Exoww" is shown to be in <br>
         an imaculate room in an upper middle class bedroom but still with a <br>
          concerned/disgusted expression on his face. This image conveys the <br> 
          message that, no matter how rich you are and how you surround yourself, <br>
            you will always experience disgust.<br>

        <p>This piece by cav3y depicts Sacha Berryman (known by the alias of "Scorpion") in your office at 12AM. From <br>
        this we can infur that Sacha has a lot of power and is something to be feared. However, the 'Juju on that Beat <br> 
        Family Accident' thumbnail is his hamartia and can be used to defeat him. The message behind this image is that <br>
        no matter how powerful and scary something can be, it always has a weakness which can be exploited to gain power <br> 
        over it and defeat it.
