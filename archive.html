        <p>As the Seven Server members ease their way into their new colleges, everyone seems to be getting on<br>
             just fine (apart from Matt but he always has something going on). However, the work load does<br>
              seem to be taking a toll on everyone's minds especially after the three months of no work.<br>
               Also, as per usual, cav3y is disapointed with the new fortnite season (thanks Donald).</p>
