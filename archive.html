        <h3><i>October 2nd 2021</i></h3>
         <p>The bicester trip was awful and no one is happy (apart from Harry he got a really nice Off-White<br>
           jacket that looks really good and will hopefully last him a long time. It is a black jean jacket <br>
           with the new off white arrows on the back (the ones that go small on the inside) and there are 2 hands <br>
            handshaking in the middle I think it looks really nice and I'm happy I got it.
        </p>
        <h3><i>September 28th 2021</i></h3>
         <p>With the long awaited trip to Bicester Village just around the corner, the members of Seven are <br> 
            making sure they're keeping their money up in preporation for any potention drip. In other news, <br>
            it seems that a few of the members of Seven have resorted to Fortnite. Harry is very happy with <br>
             this (as expected) but will soon by shut down by everyone quitting the game again.
            <br>
        </p>
        
        <h3><i>September 22nd 2021</i></h3>
         <p>Now that the members of seven are settled into college, the members are starting <br>
        to organise social (to some extent) gatherings with lots of alcohol! As the members <br>
        get lit, pissed and faded (especially Kyle) memories are being made.
        <br>
        </p>

        <h3><i>September 17th 2021</i></h3>
        <p>As the Seven Server members ease their way into their new colleges, everyone seems to be getting on<br>
             just fine (apart from Matt but he always has something going on). However, the work load does<br>
              seem to be taking a toll on everyone's minds especially after the three months of no work.<br>
               Also, as per usual, cav3y is disapointed with the new fortnite season (thanks Donald).
