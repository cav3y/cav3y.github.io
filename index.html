        <p>The bicester trip was awful and no one is happy (apart from Harry he got a really nice Off-White<br>
           jacket that looks really good and will hopefully last him a long time. It is a black jean jacket <br>
           with the new off white arrows on the back (the ones that go small on the inside) and there are 2 hands <br>
            handshaking in the middle I think it looks really nice and I'm happy I got it it looks like this:

        <p>This image depicts member John_B4 cosplaying a character from the hit franchice 'Terraria'.<br>
            This shows the dangerous effects of a gaming addiction as it can damage both your mental state<br>
            and your physical state. Hopefully John can overcome this boundary in his life and we wish <br>
            him all the best (we also need him for racial diversity so pls dont die).
