        <h2>Whats new?</h2>
        <p>As the Seven Server members ease their way into their new colleges, everyone seems to be getting on<br>
             just fine (apart from Matt but he always has something going on). However, the work load does<br>
              seem to be taking a toll on everyone's minds especially after the three months of no work.<br>
               Also, as per usual, cav3y is disapointed with the new fortnite season (thanks Donald).</p>

        <p>This piece by cav3y depicts Sacha Berryman (known by the alias of "Scorpion") in your office at 12AM. From <br>
        this we can infur that Sacha has a lot of power and is something to be feared. However, the juju on that beat <br> 
        family accident thumbnail is his hamartia and can be used to defeat him. The message behind this image is that <br>
        no matter how powerful and scary something can be, it always has a weakness which can be exploited to gain power <br> 
        over it.
