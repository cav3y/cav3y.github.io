        <p>The bicester trip was awful and no one is happy (apart from Harry he got a really nice Off-White<br>
           jacket that looks really good and will hopefully last him a long time. It is a black jean jacket <br>
           with the new off white arrows on the back (the ones that go small on the inside) and there are 2 hands <br>
            handshaking in the middle I think it looks really nice and I'm happy I got it it looks like this:)
