        <h2>Whats new?</h2>
        <p>Now that the members of seven are settled into college, the members are starting <br>
        to organise social (to some extent) gatherings with lots of alcohol! As the members <br>
        get lit, pissed and faded (especially Kyle) memories are being made.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Beef status:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Henri: At college but wanting seemingly little with Seven</li>
        <li>Nathan: Back and happy in the server</li>
        <li>Thomas Bulmer: WH <img src="OMEGALUL-transparent.png" style="width: 15px;Height: 15px;"> ?</li>
            <li>Lucas Rusu: monkaW please dont hurt me</li>

        <img src="terraria.jpg" alt="Terraria">
        <p>This image depicts member John_B4 cosplaying a character from the hit franchice 'Terraria'.<br>
            This shows the dangerous effects of a gaming addiction as it can damage both your mental state<br>
            and your physical state. Hopefully John can overcome this boundary in his life and we wish <br>
            him all the best (we also need him for racial diversity so pls dont die).
