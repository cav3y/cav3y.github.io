        <h2>Whats new?</h2>
        <p>As the Seven Server members ease their way into their new colleges, everyone seems to be getting on<br>
             just fine (apart from Matt but he always has something going on). However, the work load does<br>
              seem to be taking a toll on everyone's minds especially after the three months of no work.<br>
               Also, as per usual, cav3y is disapointed with the new fortnite season (thanks Donald).</p>

        <p>This image depicts member John_B4 cosplaying a character from the hit franchice 'Terraria'.<br>
            This shows the dangerous effects of a gaming addiction as it can damage both your mental state<br>
            and your physical state. Hopefully John can overcome this boundary in his life and we wish <br>
            him all the best (we also need him for racial diversity so pls dont die).
