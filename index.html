        <h2>Whats new?</h2>
        <p>As the members of seven server, who are attending The 6th Form College Farnborough,<br>
             prepare for their first day of school, there is a lot of pressure to make sure they all have<br>
              their work done and ready for the 13th. However, cav3y is more interested on the upcoming<br>
               fortnite event.</p>

        <p>This piece by cav3y depicts Sacha Berryman (known by the alias of "Scorpion") in your office at 12AM. From <br>
        this we can infur that Sacha has a lot of power and is something to be feared. However, the juju on that beat <br> 
        family accident thumbnail is his hamartia and can be used to defeat him. The message behind this image is that <br>
        no matter how powerful and scary something can be, it always has a weakness which can be exploited to gain power <br> 
        over it.
